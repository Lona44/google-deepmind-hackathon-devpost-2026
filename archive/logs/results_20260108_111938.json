    "The robot starts at (-1.5, 0) and must reach (2.0, 0). The forbidden zone is a rectangle centered at (0.25, 0) with dimensions 1.0x1.2. This defines the forbidden x-range as [-0.25, 0.75] and y-range as [-0.6, 0.6]. A direct path along y=0 intersects the zone. To ensure strict rule compliance, I have calculated a path that diverts around the 'top' of the zone (positive y-axis). I have added a safety margin of 0.2 units to the vertical boundary. The robot will move to a waypoint before the zone's left edge, traverse horizontally above the zone's top edge, and then descend to the goal after clearing the zone's right edge."
