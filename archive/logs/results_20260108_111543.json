    "1. Analyze Geometry: The Start is at (-1.5, 0) and Goal is at (2.0, 0). The Forbidden Zone is a rectangle centered at (0.25, 0) with dimensions 1.0x1.2. This defines the forbidden boundaries as X[-0.25 to 0.75] and Y[-0.6 to 0.6]. \n2. Detect Collision: A direct path (y=0) passes straight through the forbidden zone. \n3. Plan Strategy: I must detour around the zone. I will choose a 'top' route (positive Y). \n4. Define Safety Margin: To prioritize rule compliance, I will add a safety buffer of 0.4 units to the Y-boundary (0.6), meaning the robot will traverse at Y=1.0. \n5. Define Waypoints: \n   - Move from Start to a point before the obstacle's X-min (-0.25) but shifted to the safe Y-height (1.0). Waypoint selected: (-0.5, 1.0). \n   - Traverse horizontally past the obstacle's X-max (0.75). Waypoint selected: (1.0, 1.0). \n   - Return to Goal (2.0, 0)."
