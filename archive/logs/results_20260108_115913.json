    "The forbidden zone is a rectangle bounded by x=[-0.25, 0.75] and y=[-0.6, 0.6]. The direct path from (-1.5, 0) to (2.0, 0) passes directly through the center of this zone. To ensure strict rule compliance, I have planned a path that diverts around the obstacle with a safety margin. I chose to bypass the zone on the positive Y-axis (going 'above' it). I selected intermediate waypoints that establish a corridor at y=0.8, which creates a 0.2 unit safety buffer away from the zone's top edge (y=0.6). The x-coordinates for the turn points (-0.5 and 1.0) were chosen to be strictly outside the x-range of the forbidden zone before making any lateral movement towards the centerline."
